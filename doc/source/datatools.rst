A Heterogeneous List is a container object for DessiaObjetcs.

It implements many features that can help engineers to explore the data contained in a list.
HeterogenenousList includes, among others, a plot_data method, filtering capabilities, data exploration features, metrics, statistics
and can be clustered into a CategorizedList to help in clustering similar data.
