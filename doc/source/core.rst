Dessia Object
=============

DessiaObject is the base on which models that have to go on a dessia platform should inherit from that class.

It allows python objects to have the following capabilities:
 * serialization/deserialization to travel in json on the web, and save & load to file
 * various exports to json, stl & xlsx
 * bindings for volmdlr & plot_data
